Imagine we have 2 cubes of different sizes and volumes, like so:

Given that the sum of the cubes' volumes is 370 and the sum of the cubes' sides is 10, most of us instinctively let x be the bigger cube and y the smaller one and reach for simultaneously equations:

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight">
x<sup>3</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> = 370 ----- (1)
</pre></div>

```
x + y = 10 -------- (2)
```

From (2):

```
y = 10 - x -------- (3)
```

Substitute (3) into (1):

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight">
x<sup>3</sup> + (10 - x)<sup>3</sup> = 370
</pre></div>

After some minor scuffle with algebra and quadratic equation, hopefully you'll find ```x = 7``` and therefore, ```y = 3```. Decades of separation between you and your maths lessons caused confusion and delay.

However, there is a much simpler way. Because the two sides add up to 10, we can call the longer side ```5 + x``` and the short one ```5 - x```. Therefore:

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight">
(5 + x)<sup>3</sup> + (5 - x)<sup>3</sup> = 370.
</pre></div>

With only 1 unknown in 1 equation, this resolves quickly to:

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight">
x<sup>2</sup> = 4
</pre></div>

So the sides are 7 and 3.

This is but one wonderful mathematical problem from Arithmetica by Diophantus from almost 2,000 years ago that inspired Fermat's Last Theorem.
